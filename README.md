Made in JavaScript Node.

This project was made for "Data structures and algorithms" at Computer science & Engineering University(Year 2, Sem 1) as a mandatory project. 

The project is an expansion of the base model provided by Facebook. 

It is capable of receiving API data from the page's chat and responding accordingly based on a multitude of pre recorded commands situated inside a case.

I took in account every type of usual questions any person may have, and I tried to complete any type of narrative by closing the dialogue loop and making it an finite automata.
